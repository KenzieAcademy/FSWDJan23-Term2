    <h2>Comparing Objects</h2>
    <p>
      Alex and Max clearly share the same car. So if you asked each of them to point to their car, they'll point to the
      same car. But the stranger, who has the same make, model, etc. car, will not point to the same car as Alex and
      Max.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can make copies of objects, but we may also need to check, whether two copies are made of the same parts. This
      can be done in a couples of ways. We can compare the <strong>structure</strong> of two objects, or we can compare
      the <strong>values</strong> of the two objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparing the structure would be like asking two people if they both owned a pickup truck. This involves ensuring
      that both objects have the same <strong>properties</strong>, and disregarding the values of those properties.
